    Undergraduate Thesis: <i>Developing a Semi-Analytical Model for High-Speed Rotor Whirl Prediction</i>
  </p>
  <p class="description">
  <img src="imgs/btechthesis.png" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 16px">
    Most fully analytical treatments of rotor whirl are restricted to very simple rotor
geometries, and have limited use while studying real-world rotors. Analysis of more
complex rotors is routinely carried out in Finite Element software such as Ansys, but
this is less effective at generating fundamental insights to inform the design process.
This thesis develops a rotor whirl model of intermediate complexity, following some analytical insights into whirling resonance in rotors.

    Whirl in Rotors on Aerostatic Thrust Bearing
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    <img src="imgs/thrustrotor.png" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 16px">
    This is a MATLAB tool to perform modal rotordynamic analysis for homogenous isotropic axysymmetric rotors of stepped or arbitrary profile supported laterally by multiple short bearings with linear compliance and axially by an aerostatic thrust bearing. The axial load from the pressure integral over an impeller or turbine is transmitte through the rotor shaft and the aerostatic bearing to the stator. Nonlinear constitutive relations for the bearing are estimated by fitting a modified power law to simulation data, and local lineaarizations are then used to derive the dynamics at various load and gap values.

    Pipe Wrapping

    A straight strip of material (e.g. tape) can be wrapped helically around a straight length of pipe. This is not the case for pipes with bends. This is a tool I wrote to calculate a shape of strip that can be wrapped around a given pipe with arbitrary bends.

    Simulation of Blood Flow in Mechanical Heart Valve Prostheses
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    <img src="imgs/heartvalve.png" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 16px">
    Various designs exist for Mechanical Heart Valves, but each of them has significant differences in operation from a natural heart valve. This paper (presented at BIT Mesra's internal thermo-fluids conference ICTFSD 2022) considers representative examples of a few popular classes of MHV, and presents FEM simulations of the flow through them in vitro. A comparison is made between the simulation results for each type of valve with a focus on factors contributing to clotting - including flow velocity, shear stress and
stagnation - as well as on leakage or regurgitation. A simulation-based insight is therefore developed for the relative strengths and weaknesses of each type of valve, and this insight is discussed in the context of common practices in the
medical field.

    Rolled-Metal Lamp Wick
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    <img src="imgs/spiralwick.png" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 16px">
    This was my project submission for a graduate Microfluidics course. My idea was to create a combination of macro and micro-channels between successive layers of rolled sheet metal. The result is a working metal lamp wick with several tweakable design parameters. I tested a few different wicks and commented on the effects of packing tensity, taper, and mouth profile on various aspects of performance or flame behavior.

    Neon Lamp Distortion
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    <img src="imgs/neondist.png" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 16px">
    Gas discharge chambers show complicated electrical behavior, such as strong nonlinearity and hysteresis. This device boosts the voltage level of an audio signal using an amplifier and transformer to the levels required to start conduction in a small noble-gas indicator lamp, thus distorting the signal in interesting and musically useful ways difficult to achieve using solid-state electronics.

    Auto-Advance Mechanical Pencil Poster
  </p>
  <p class="description">
  <img src="imgs/autopencil.png" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 16px">
    Auto-advance mechanical pencils dispense just the right amount of lead as they write, simultaneously protecting the lead from breaking and eliminating the need to manually click or shake the pencil as the lead wears out. When I first found out about these pencils, I was fascinated by what they did but couldn't find much information about how they worked. One source I did find seemed to describe a different mechanism from what I found in pencils I bought. I therefore took one apart and attempted a "reverse-engineered" poster explaining the mechanism.

    Line-of-Sight Stabilization Gyroscope
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    <img src="imgs/gyro.png" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 16px">
    Line-of sight stabilization for optical  devices mounted on moving vehicles can be performed using correcting mirrors coupled to a gimballed gyroscope through a 1:2 kinematic coupling. In such a system, the dependence of the response on forcing can be shown to scale with the inertia of the mirror, marking an important difference in dynamic behavior from free-gimballed gyroscopes. This is a study through numerical dynamic simulations of the error in line-of-sight correction in such a system, i.e. its performance, as affected by design parameters and the frequency and amplitude of forcing.
